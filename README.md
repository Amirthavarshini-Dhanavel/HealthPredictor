# Smart Health Prediction System

A smart health prediction system is a system that may precisely identify probable illnesses based on patient symptoms and deliver prompt probable disease with the aid of machine learning algorithms like decision tree classifier, random forest classifier, and others.
<br><br>
This system will have two functional modules- the backend and the frontend. The backend will be responsible for training pre-built machine learning algorithms with some past data about the illness of the patients and the related symptoms. The testing dataset will be used to check if the system is precisely able to predict the diseases with great accuracy. Two predefined algorithms will be used to predict the illness and the accuracy of both can be compared.

## Features
